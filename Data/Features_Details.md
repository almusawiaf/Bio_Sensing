# Features 
In this study we already observed some of the features of individual cell. For the diagnosis of cancer compare to normal cell we want to find almost 53 features. These are described below.
## Morphological Features 
This is study of mainly shape and size. Basically the external structure and appearance of the cell are under these morphological features. Two types of features are classified like, Shape features and Size features. 
### Size Features

- Cellular Area (area of whole cell)
- Nuclear Area (only nucleus area)
- Cytoplasmic Area (Cellular Area -  Nuclear Area)
- Major Axis of Cell (Longest diameter of cell)
- Minor Axis of Cell (Shortest diameter of cell)
- Major Axis of Nucleus (Longest diameter of nucleus)
- Minor Axis of Nucleus (Shortest diameter of nucleus)
- Cellular Aspect Ratio (Major to Minor Axis Ratio of Cell = Major Axis : Minor Axis)
- Nuclear Aspect Ratio (Major to Minor Axis Ratio of Nucleus = Major Axis : Minor Axis)
- Cellular Diameter ((Major Axis of Cell + Minor Axis of Cell)/2)
- Nuclear Diameter ((Major Axis of Nucleus + Minor Axis of Nucleus)/2)
- N:C Ratio (Ratio of Cytoplasmic Area to Nuclear Area = Cytoplasmic Area : Nuclear Area)

### Shape Features 

- Cellular Perimeter (Perimeter of whole cell)
- Nuclear Perimeter (Perimeter of nucleus)
- Cytoplasmic Perimeter (Cellular Perimeter + Nuclear Perimeter)

## Metabolic Features 
This describes the chemical, physical and biological features of cell. The mitochondrial function is one of the examples in these metabolic features.

### Intensity 
Intensity showed the different colour variations here. In different exposure and different emission are configuring three primary colours such as red, green and blue. This intensity is changes due the biological properties. 
- Red Intensity 
- Green Intensity 
- Blue Intensity  

## Haralick Features 
This feature is defined as a function of one or more measurements, each of which specifies some quantifiable property of an object. It quantifies some significant characteristics of the object. 
- Contrast (quantity of local changes in image)
- Energy (uniformity of the image)
- Entropy (measure a randomness of intensity image)
- Homogeneity (measures similarity of pixels)
- Correlation (measures how correlated a pixel to its neighbourhood)
- Variance (to evaluate the uncertainty degree)
- Difference Entropy (difference among pixel entropy)
- Sum Variance (sum of each and every pixel uniformity)
- Sum Average (Measure the average of the gray level within an image)
- Inverse Difference Moment (measures the image homogeneity assumes larger value for smaller gray level difference in pair element)
- Cluster Prominance (forth order normalized gray-tone spatial dependence factor present with standard deviation)
- Cluster Tendency (Measure the grouping of pixels that have similar gray values)
- Cluster Shade (cubic normalized gray-tone spatial dependence factor present with standard deviation)
- Inertia (moment of certain particular weighted average of image pixel intensity)
- Sum of Square Variance (some of the squared deviation)
- Angular Second Moment (textural uniformity of pixel pair distributions)
- Information Measure of Correlation – I (spatial distribution of the image in one dimension)
- Information Measure of Correlation – II (spatial distribution of the image in different dimensions)

## Textural Features 
This is basically the gray tone spatial dependencies for category identification tasks. This is also classified by some different characteristics. 
- Cellular Roundness (measures how closely the shape of whole cell approaches that of a mathematically perfect circle)
- Cellular Solidity (measure of change in cellular area with respect to convex area)
- Cellular Rim Difference (average difference between cell perimeter from circular convex area)
- Cellular Eccentricity (measure of cell outline)
- Cellular Convex Area (curved shape of the whole cell)
- Nuclear Roundness (measures how closely the shape of nucleus approaches that of a mathematically perfect circle)
- Nuclear Solidity (measure of change in nuclear area with respect to convex area)
- Nuclear Eccentricity (measure of nucleus outline)
- Nuclear Convex Area (curved shape of the nucleus)
- Radial Asymmetric (measures the asymmetric representation of the cellular axis to its shape)

## Tamura Features 
It provides the surface characteristics and appearance of the objects present in images. 
- Coarseness (measures the brightness and contrast compare to other)
- Directionality (measures the line-likeness, blob-likeness, regularity, uniformity of the image)
